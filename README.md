# Stopwatch Reflex Game

This simple digital stopwatch keeps track of time in tenths of a second. The stopwatch has three buttons -- Start, Stop, and Reset. In addition to a visually rendering the stopwatch onto the canvas, there is also a game featuer that tests your reflexes. In the upper right corner are two counters (set to 0/0 when the program runs or is reset). These counters track the number of times the Stop button is pressed against the number of successful stops at a whole second (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, etc.).


This program is an exercise in combining text drawing in the canvas with timers. It was submitted as a mini-project to Rice University's online course, Fundamentals of Computing Specialization, offered through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/fundamentalscomputing2).
